<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial dialysis device market is primarily divided into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves filtering blood through an external machine, which is connected to a patient's vascular system, effectively removing waste and excess fluid. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's abdominal cavity as a natural filter, where a dialysis solution is infused and drained to remove toxins. Both methods cater to patients with renal failure, providing essential life-sustaining treatment options.</p></p>
