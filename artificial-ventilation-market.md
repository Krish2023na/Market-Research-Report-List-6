<p><h1>Artificial Ventilation Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Artificial Ventilation Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Artificial ventilation refers to the method of mechanically supporting or replacing natural breathing in patients who are unable to ventilate adequately on their own. This is achieved through devices like ventilators, which deliver controlled breaths and ensure adequate gas exchange in critical care and emergency settings. The importance of artificial ventilation has increased due to rising incidences of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other acute respiratory conditions.</p><p>The artificial ventilation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.00% during the forecast period. Key trends influencing this growth include advancements in technology, such as the development of portable ventilators and smart monitoring systems, which enhance patient management. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence into ventilator systems is improving patient outcomes and optimizing device performance. Increasing awareness about the importance of respiratory care and rising healthcare expenditures are further contributing to market expansion. The demand for home care ventilation solutions is also on the rise, driven by the shift towards outpatient care and the growing elderly population, creating new opportunities for market players.</p></p>
