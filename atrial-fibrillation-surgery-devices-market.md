<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices market primarily includes Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery methods. Catheter Ablation involves using a catheter to deliver energy that destroys abnormal heart tissue, restoring normal rhythm. This minimally invasive procedure is increasingly popular due to its effectiveness. Conversely, Maze Surgery is a more invasive technique where a series of incisions are made in the heart to create a "maze" of scar tissue, directing electrical signals properly. Both approaches aim to improve patient outcomes in managing atrial fibrillation.</p></p>
