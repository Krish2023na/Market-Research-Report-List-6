<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axle Counter Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rail Side Installation</li><li>On-rail Installation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axle counter systems are crucial for railway traffic monitoring and safety, categorized into two main market types: rail-side installation and on-rail installation. Rail-side installation involves positioning sensors and counting mechanisms alongside tracks to monitor train movements without interfering with rail operations. In contrast, on-rail installation integrates axle counters directly onto the railway tracks, providing real-time data on train positions and improving monitoring accuracy. Both types enhance operational efficiency and safety in railway systems.</p></p>
