<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Fibre Optics Sensing Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OTDR</li><li>OFDR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distributed Fibre Optics Sensing Technology is used in two different market types, OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometry) and OFDR (Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry). OTDR technology measures the time it takes for a light pulse to travel along a fibre optic cable and reflect back, providing information on the cable's integrity. OFDR technology uses a different approach by analyzing the frequency of scattered light to detect changes in the fibre optic cable. Both technologies offer unique advantages for different applications within the distributed fibre optics sensing market.</p></p>
