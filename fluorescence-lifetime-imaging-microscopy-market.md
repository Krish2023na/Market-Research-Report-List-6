<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-Domain</li><li>Frequency-Domain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a technique used in biological imaging to study the fluorescence lifetime of molecules. There are two main types of FLIM markets - Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain. In Time-Domain FLIM, the lifetime of fluorescence is measured directly by recording the time it takes for a molecule to emit light. In Frequency-Domain FLIM, the lifetime is calculated by modulating the excitation light at a high frequency and analyzing the phase delay of the emitted fluorescence. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in biological research.</p></p>
