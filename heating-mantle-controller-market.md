<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heating Mantle Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Circuit</li><li>Single Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heating mantle controllers come in two main types: double circuit and single circuit. Double circuit controllers have two separate circuits that control the temperature and power supply independently, allowing for more precise temperature control and increased safety. Single circuit controllers have only one circuit that controls both temperature and power supply, which may result in less precise temperature regulation but can be a more cost-effective option for certain applications. Both types of controllers play a crucial role in maintaining desired temperatures during laboratory experiments.</p></p>
