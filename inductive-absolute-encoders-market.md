<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Absolute Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Turn</li><li>Multi-turn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive absolute encoders are categorized into two main market types: single-turn and multi-turn encoders. Single-turn encoders provide a unique position value within one rotation, typically 360 degrees, making them suitable for applications that require precise angular measurement without the need for multi-turn functionality. In contrast, multi-turn encoders track the position over multiple rotations, offering a comprehensive position over extended movements. This capability is crucial for applications involving continuous rotation or extensive travel distances, enhancing overall system accuracy and reliability.</p></p>
