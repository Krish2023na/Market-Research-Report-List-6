<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intumescent Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellulose</li><li>Hydrocarbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intumescent coatings are classified into two main types: cellulose-based and hydrocarbon-based. Cellulose-based intumescent coatings contain cellulose derivatives that swell and expand when exposed to fire, creating a protective char layer that insulates the underlying substrate. On the other hand, hydrocarbon-based intumescent coatings contain hydrocarbon polymers that also expand when heated, forming a protective barrier against flames and heat. Both types of intumescent coatings are widely used in the construction industry for fireproofing purposes.</p></p>
