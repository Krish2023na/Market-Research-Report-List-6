<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Invasive Ventilator for Anti snoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-level Ventilator</li><li>Bi-level Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive ventilator market for anti-snoring solutions comprises two main types: single-level ventilators and bi-level ventilators. Single-level ventilators maintain a constant airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle, providing steady airflow that helps prevent airway collapse during sleep. Bi-level ventilators, on the other hand, offer two pressure settings—one for inhalation and a lower one for exhalation—allowing for greater comfort and adaptability for users with varying respiratory needs. Both types aim to enhance sleep quality and reduce snoring incidents.</p></p>
