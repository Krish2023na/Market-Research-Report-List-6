<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning window market comprises two primary types based on coating technology: hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings. Hydrophilic coatings attract water, allowing dirt and grime to wash away easily when rain occurs. These coatings facilitate the formation of a continuous water film, promoting cleaner surfaces. In contrast, hydrophobic coatings repel water, creating a beading effect that prevents dirt from adhering to the glass, allowing it to roll off easily. Both technologies enhance cleanliness, reduce maintenance, and improve energy efficiency in buildings.</p></p>
