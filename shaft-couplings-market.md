<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shaft Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible Couplings</li><li>Rigid Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shaft couplings are devices used to connect two shafts together in order to transmit power. There are two main types of shaft couplings in the market - flexible couplings and rigid couplings. Flexible couplings allow for some misalignment between the shafts and can absorb shock and vibration, making them ideal for applications where precise alignment is difficult. Rigid couplings, on the other hand, do not allow for any misalignment and are best suited for applications where shafts need to be perfectly aligned for efficient power transmission.</p></p>
