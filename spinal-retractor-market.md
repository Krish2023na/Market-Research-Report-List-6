<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Retractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Retractors</li><li>Blade Retractor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal retractor market is categorized into two main types: tubular retractors and blade retractors. Tubular retractors are designed to facilitate minimally invasive surgeries, providing a narrow channel that allows access to the spine while minimizing tissue disruption. Blade retractors, on the other hand, feature broader blades that can hold back tissue, allowing surgeons better visibility and access during open procedures. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing surgical outcomes and improving patient recovery times in spinal surgeries.</p></p>
