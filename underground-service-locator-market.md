<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underground Service Locator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Location</li><li>Passive Location</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Underground Service Locator market is divided into two primary types: active location and passive location. Active location involves the use of signal-emitting devices, such as electromagnetic equipment, which actively transmit signals to identify underground utilities. In contrast, passive location relies on detecting naturally occurring signals or reflections from buried services without the need for external signal application. Both methods are essential for ensuring safe excavation and construction by accurately locating underground utilities and preventing accidental damage.</p></p>
